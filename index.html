        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am a first-year majoring in Pre-Business at UCR. It is almost the end of my first year here at UCR and my experience has been nothing but the best. I chose this major because I have always wanted to work with something business related. Marketing just really spoke to me, I have took many classes and this is my path. I resonated with learning about the mechanics of marketing. I am sure this is the path I want to take. I have a couple marketing internships lined up and this just automatically will help set me up for my future job. I will have the experiences and mechanics of how the work is done. Marketing will be something I will always love and cherish. Majoring in Business Marketing gives me a variety of knowledge and information in order for me to succeed at my job after graduating college. I had worked at a boba shop, Trader Joes, grocery store, and McDonalds before. I believe this proves that I am capable to handle anything. I have dealt with many bad experiences with costumers, managers, and many more. The internships that I had in the past were really great. It helped me learn many new things. It had just gave me an in-depth and hands-on experience with working with a work setting I want to be in. I have the experience and I know how to deal with people. I am in multiple clubs such as NSU, Business Marketing Frat, and Girl Gains. All of these clubs has not only made me more social but has I have gained many opportunities. Such as being on board for Business Marketing Frat and NSU. I have gained more skills other than Marketing which I am very grateful for. 
<br><br>

        I have had many special and unique opportunities to find my strengths and weaknesses. From meeting my best friends here to helping the community has always been really helpful. My first year at UCR has its ups and downs but I would not change it. It is the experiences and happenings that really make it all worth it. From the study sessions and homework cram sessions. It has always been a really fun time with the people around me. The people I have met here has made me the person who I am today. Without them I would not be the same person. They have pushed me to grow as a person and a student. They have always been there for me whenever I needed them. I am very grateful that I have so many people that care about me. <br><br>

        
My goal is to find a job who supports all my needs. I want to market a business and I am sure I have the skills to do exactly that and even more. With my past experiences, it is obviously shown that I am a person who succeeds and can do even more than that. My past work has been really successful and it just shows how dedicated I am as a person and student.
